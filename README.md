# 464_Message_Bus_Activity

This project involves working in groups of 2-3 people to come up with an idea for a microservices architecture, and then implementing a message bus using RabbitMQ (or Kafka). The goal is to improve communication of views and collaborate on the architecture as a team.

Each group is responsible for coming up with at least 6 services for their idea, and determining the type of messages they will exchange. They will then implement the message bus using RabbitMQ (or Kafka), using the appropriate client libraries to publish and consume messages from the message bus.

This project provides an opportunity for students to work in groups and practice their programming and software development skills, while also gaining experience with microservices architecture and message bus technologies.
